Instructions on installing Docker for Mac OSX using Boot2Docket -> add step-by-step instructions when installed

- In the book, some examples will prompt to connect to localhost but each Docker has its own network interface and IP
address. Use that instead. To find the Boot2Docker IP address, see book.

- Any example that use volumens or the "docker run" command with the -v flag will not work with Boot2Docker. Must use
a Linux based host with Docker for these examples (ch5 and ch6).
